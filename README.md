# Design-of-Multiband-Negative-Permittivity-Metamaterial-Based-on-Interdigitated-and-Meander-Line-Reso
HFSS tool is used to design negative multiband metamaterial with PEC and PMC boundary conditions.
HFSS tool gives us s-parameters values at each frequency (S11, S21 both magnitude and phase).
These S-parameter values are processed under Kramers-Kronig relationship to get values of permittivity and permeability at each frequency.
Proposed resonator has three resonance frequencies at 6.18 GHz, 7.71 GHz and 9.36 GHz.
At each frequency effective permittivity is negative thus it is negative permittivity metamaterial.
